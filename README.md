Nigerian Used-Car Market Price Analysis (SQL Project)
Introduction
Nigeria's used-car market is large, fast-moving, and highly informal, with prices shaped by brand reputation, import condition, age, mileage, and buyer purchasing power. For most buyers and small dealers, understanding "fair value" means comparing a listing against dozens of similar ones by eye — a slow and error-prone process.
This project analyzes a dataset of 4,095 car listings from the Nigerian used-car market, covering brand (Make), year of manufacture, condition (Brand New / Foreign Used / Nigerian Used), mileage, engine size, fuel type, transmission, and price (in Naira).
The raw data required cleaning before it could be trusted: prices were stored as text with comma separators (e.g. "3,120,000"), a number of mileage and engine-size entries were impossible outliers (one listing showed nearly 10 million kilometres), and several categorical fields (condition, fuel, transmission) had blank entries. All of this was cleaned directly in SQL, with every step commented in the accompanying .sql script.
The cleaned dataset was then used to answer 15 beginner-level business questions using core SQL techniques: SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT, aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX), CASE WHEN bucketing, and a simple subquery.
Problem Statement
Car listings in Nigeria are rarely benchmarked against structured market data. Buyers often cannot tell whether a price is fair for a car's brand, age, and mileage; sellers and dealers similarly lack a simple, data-backed way to price their stock competitively.
At the same time, raw scraped listing data is not usable out of the box — inconsistent formatting (prices as text), unrealistic outlier values, and missing fields all stand between the raw file and a trustworthy answer to even a simple question like "what does a Toyota typically cost?"
This project addresses that gap by using SQL to clean the dataset and then answer a set of concrete, beginner-friendly business questions that mirror how a real buyer, seller, or analyst would actually interrogate this market.
Objectives
Clean the raw car-listing data using SQL — converting text-formatted prices into real numbers, removing impossible mileage/engine-size outliers, and labelling missing categorical values clearly.
Write a single, well-structured .sql script that is thorough yet simple enough for a SQL beginner to read and learn from, with a comment on virtually every line.
Answer 15 concrete business questions covering market structure, brand pricing, condition, transmission, fuel type, car age, and mileage.
Demonstrate a range of beginner-to-early-intermediate SQL techniques (aggregate functions, GROUP BY, HAVING, CASE WHEN, subqueries, multi-condition WHERE filters) within realistic business contexts.
Translate the SQL query results into clear insights and practical recommendations for buyers, sellers, and dealers in the Nigerian used-car market.
Insights
Headline Market Snapshot
Metric	Value
Total Listings	4,095
Average Price	₦4.27M
Price Range	₦458K – ₦58.8M
The market spans an enormous range — from a ₦458,000 budget Honda to a ₦58.8 million Foreign Used Mercedes-Benz — confirming that "the used-car market" is really several very different markets bundled together.
Brand Popularity
Make	Listings
Toyota	1,469
Lexus	464
Mercedes-Benz	436
Honda	428
Ford	197
Toyota alone accounts for roughly 36% of all listings, reflecting its reputation for reliability and parts availability.
Priciest vs Most Affordable Brands (avg., min. 5 listings)
Rank	Priciest	Most Affordable
1	Land Rover — ₦10.21M	Opel — ₦1.46M
2	Jeep — ₦9.58M	Renault — ₦1.56M
3	GMC — ₦8.78M	Peugeot — ₦1.70M
4	Porsche — ₦7.66M	Mitsubishi — ₦1.92M
5	Mercedes-Benz — ₦6.27M	Volvo — ₦2.37M
Condition
Condition	Listings	% of Market	Avg. Price
Nigerian Used	2,521	61.6%	₦3.12M
Foreign Used	1,090	26.6%	₦6.09M
Not Specified	479	11.7%	₦6.01M
Brand New	5	0.1%	₦24.57M
"Nigerian Used" vehicles dominate the market by volume but are priced roughly half that of "Foreign Used" imports on average.
Age & Mileage Both Strongly Predict Price
Car Age	Listings	Avg. Price
0–5 years	143	₦16.05M
6–10 years	815	₦6.03M
11–15 years	1,633	₦3.29M
15+ years	1,026	₦1.98M
Mileage Band	Listings	Avg. Price
Low (0–50,000 km)	280	₦10.33M
Medium (50,001–150,000 km)	1,542	₦4.85M
High (150,001–300,000 km)	1,758	₦3.20M
Very High (300,000+ km)	410	₦2.54M
A 0–5 year-old car is priced roughly 8x higher on average than one over 15 years old; low-mileage cars are priced about 4x higher than very-high-mileage cars.
Transmission & Fuel
Automatic dominates listings (3,810 of 4,095) and is priced well above Manual on average (₦4.36M vs ₦2.51M).
Petrol is overwhelmingly the primary fuel type (3,535 listings); Diesel carries the highest average price (₦5.87M) among fuel types with meaningful counts.
Price Segments
Segment	Listings	Avg. Price
Budget (< ₦2M)	1,146	₦1.42M
Mid-Range (₦2M–₦5M)	2,017	₦3.21M
Premium (₦5M–₦10M)	658	₦6.76M
Luxury (₦10M+)	274	₦18.00M
Nearly half the market (49.3%) falls into the Mid-Range segment.
Widest Price Range by Brand
Mercedes-Benz has the widest spread of any brand (₦630,000 – ₦58.8M, a ₦58M+ range), followed by Nissan and Toyota — showing these brand names alone say little about expected price without also knowing condition, age, and mileage.
Recommendations
For buyers on a budget: prioritize Nigerian Used vehicles from affordable brands (Honda, Peugeot, Mitsubishi, Mazda).
For buyers prioritizing value retention: favor lower-mileage, newer vehicles — age and mileage are the two strongest single predictors of price.
For sellers and dealers: price using brand + condition + age-band + mileage-band together, not brand alone.
For dealers stocking inventory: the Mid-Range segment (₦2M–₦5M) represents roughly half of all market activity — prioritize stock here.
For platforms collecting this kind of data: enforce numeric-only price fields at entry and add range validation on mileage/engine size to prevent extreme outliers.
For further analysis: extend this SQL project with year-over-year trend queries or a join against a brand country-of-origin/import-duty reference table to explain price gaps in terms of cost structure rather than brand prestige alone.
Conclusions
This project turned a raw, inconsistently formatted CSV of 4,095 Nigerian car listings into a clean SQL table and answered 15 practical business questions using beginner-friendly, heavily commented SQL. The analysis confirms that condition, car age, and mileage are the dominant, intuitive drivers of price, that Toyota's market dominance is driven by both volume and mid-range affordability, and that the market is heavily concentrated in the Mid-Range price segment.
Beyond the specific findings, the accompanying .sql script is itself a learning resource: it demonstrates real-world SQL data cleaning (REPLACE, CAST, COALESCE, CASE WHEN for outlier handling) alongside a full suite of beginner analytical patterns (GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT, subqueries, multi-condition filtering) — all applied to a single, realistic Nigerian dataset from start to finish.
